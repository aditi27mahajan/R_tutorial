Data analysis with R is done in a series of steps; programming, transforming, discovering, modeling and communicate the results

Program:
     R is a clear and accessible programming tool
Transform:
     R is made up of a collection of libraries designed specifically for data science
Discover:
     Investigate the data, refine your hypothesis and analyze them
Model:
     R provides a wide array of tools to capture the right model for your data
Communicate:
     Integrate codes, graphs, and outputs to a report with R Markdown or build Shiny apps to share with the world
R language is used for :
         1) Statistical inference
         2) Data analysis
         3) Machine learning algorithm
